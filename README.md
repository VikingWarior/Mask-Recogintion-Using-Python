# Mask-Recogintion-Using-Python
This project can recognize whether, a given subject/s is wearing a mask or not with the help Convolutional Neural networks and Machine learning. This project is built in python using libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV and Numpy. This model has an accuracy of around 49 %.

Pre-requsites :
1. Tensorflow and Keras (GPU support is recommended)
2. OpenCV
3. NumPy
4. A working webcam

Instructions :
1. Extract the rar file in your project directory.
2. Open mask.py file and run it.
